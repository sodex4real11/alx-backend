The ALX Project: Queuing System in JS
The Queuing System in JS is designed to manage and organize a queue of tasks or jobs. It is particularly useful in scenarios where tasks need to be processed in a sequential order or based on certain priorities. The system includes features such as adding tasks to the queue, removing tasks, and processing tasks in a synchronous or asynchronous manner.
