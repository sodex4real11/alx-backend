i18n: The ALX Project
This project demonstrates the implementation of internationalization (i18n) in a Flask web application using the Flask-Babel extension. The application displays a basic webpage with localized messages based on the user's preferred language. Additionally, it allows emulation of a user login system by passing a user ID as a URL parameter.
