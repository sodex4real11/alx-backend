This project focuses on implementing and using a __Pagination__ system,  allowing users to divide large sets of data into smaller,  manageable chunks for easier navigation  and improved user experience.  Pagination` is a common feature in web applications, enabling users to view content in sequences without overwhelming them with a vast amount of information at once.
